## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Start the local development server:

```sh
pnpm start
```

Run the Jest test suite:

```sh
pnpm test --watchAll=false
```

Create a production build:

```sh
pnpm build
```

## CI/CD Validation

The `mark-merge` branch has passing CI/CD validation. The CI workflow installs dependencies with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, runs the Jest suite, and creates a production build. The CD workflow builds the deployable artifact, serves the generated `build/` directory, smoke-tests the HTML and static assets over HTTP, and uploads the build artifact.
